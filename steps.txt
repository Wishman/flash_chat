Section 15 - Flash Chat - Flutter x Firebase Cloud Firestore

1. L-158 & 160: add routes
1.1 create static id prop in each Screen
1.2 create route with key: ScreenName.id (no ScreenName() due to static id var!)
1.3 add Navigator.push() to welcome screen login & registration button (V1)
    or use .pushNamed() (V2)

2. L-161: Flutter Hero Animations
Task: create a transition animation between welcome_screen and registration_screen with lightning logo
2.1 in welcome_screen wrap Container with logo.png in Hero Widget with tag: 'logo'
2.2 in registration_screen, wrap Container in Hero Widget with tag 'logo'
-- enough for a basic animation, as position & size are different on second screen
2.3 same for login_screen
